what can we do to establish a comfortable culture of mutual respect in the classroom

I teach in a STEM magnet program and I am also a graduate of this program. I can build empathy by finding out what big STEM problems the students are interested in and then show where my subject can solve parts of such things. I can do so in a way where students collaborate to find the solutions, either with each other or they collaborate with me role playing some other stakeholder. Also, I can appeal to their naturally occuring teams and groups as my students have already been working together for 2 years prior to taking my class, and I can use our shared history/background to build connections. I can use humor and vulnerability in solving problems, getting things wrong, making corrections, checking each other etc. to help the respect be evident.
